## Setup

Once you have logged in to Edlab, you can clone this repo using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umass-cs-377/3
```

Then you can use `cd` to open the directory you just cloned:

```bash
cd 377-
```

This repo includes a Makefile that allows you to locally compile and run all the sample code listed in this tutorial. You can compile them by running `make`. Feel free to modify the source files yourself, after making changes you can run `make` again to build new binaries from your modified files. You can also use `make clean` to remove all the built files, this command is usually used when something went wrong during the compilation so that you can start fresh.
